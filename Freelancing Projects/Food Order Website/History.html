          believed to have originated from the Russian word “bystro,” which means “quickly.
          ” According to a popular legend, this term was used by Russian soldiers during the 
          occupation of Paris in 1815 when they wanted food and drink. A more credible etymology
           traces the name to “bistrouille,” a northern French term for a mixture of 
           coffee and eau-de-vie, which was a common order in 19th-century Parisian bistros.

    Bistros emerged as small, neighborhood restaurants in Paris during the 19th century.
     They were known for serving simple, hearty meals and offering a casual, convivial atmosphere.
      Over time, the concept of the bistro spread to other parts of the world, including the United States, 
      where it has evolved into a variety of different styles and formats.
